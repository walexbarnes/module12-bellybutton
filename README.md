# module12-bellybutton

This challenge loads data from a JSON object using D3. That data is manipulated on page load of the index.html file to display data for any given 'id' within the object. On page load, the data is displayed for the user with the ID of 940. Visitors can manipulate the data by selecting another ID within the dropdown, at which time the data will be dynamically updated based on the code in the plots.js file.
